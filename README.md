#Low Rate DoS Using Count-min Sketch in p4

Worked on count-min sketch to detect the attack in SDN and mitigation strategy involves deleting the malicious flow rules for which consecutive recurrence is three and update the count to zero.

Developed mathematical idle timeout modeling for countering the flow table overflow attack. (\textbf{Under the IEEE Transactions of Network and Service Management review})
